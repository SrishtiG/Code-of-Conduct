//Code of Conduct for Life(written in C)
//let this blank page be the world without life, we want to give the world life

//first we will give the life form knowledge, how to decipher the difference between and, or, not, implies; and how to decipher the difference between true and false, without returning anything new to the world. What distinguishes a life-form from a material object, is the ability to never forget to run this main function: 

void main(int void){
	return learn(lifeform);
}

#include <stdio.h>  //the difference between and, or, not and implies
#include <bool.h>  // the difference between true and false

//Now, we shall define a lifeform. A life form is an object without life but with a nature 
//that is either true or false. If the life form has a true nature, it’s number of current successes is countable, 
//and that individual life-form is constantly changing and growing. 
//Else, the life form has a false nature and it stops growing and dies. 

typedef lifeform (bool nature); 

Int success; //alternatively defined as a life form's ability to feel content (to feel the sixth sense)

lifeform You = true; 	
//we have a new lifeform in the world! It’s a baby called you. This baby’s nature is true; you have yet to grow.
//Now, this new lifeform has one function, that is to try and constantly execute the main function. 
//That requires knowing how to learn. 
//Knowing how to learn requires knowing how to return to the world what the lifeform has learned such that 
//the world remains in its neutral, void state. We will know break down the main function into two essential 
//functions: the Learn function, and the Help function, so that you can execute these two functions. 

void Learn(lifeform you);
void Help (lifeform you);

void Learn(lifeform you){
	while(you){				//while you’re nature is true
		++ success;			//you increase the global smile-count
		return Help(you);		//and help yourself smile as a result
	}
}

void Help(lifeform you){
            	while(you){         //while you’re nature is true
		++ success;                   //by learning you make your teacher smile
		return Learn(you);           //your teacher learns that you understand and moves on
	}
}

//This is the program all life forms run to stay alive. 


//Written by Srishti, in C, inspired by all the life forms I interact with and have interacted with in the past.
//This program is what gets me up early every morning, and keeps me up at night, because I constantly seek to 
//Learn and Help every life-form I interact with by asking them to Help me by helping me Learn, 
//or by giving Help to another life-form I cannot help.
//Just like You do everyday at work. 
//Thank you for being a life form and for keeping me, and the other life forms around you alive. 
//Love is logically equal to Success which is logically equal to the feeling of being alone 
//and with some other life form at the same time, or any other feeling of content.
//That’s why eggs need shelter while the life-form inside them grows. 

//If you smiled even once reading this then that counts as proof, according to the execution of this program 
//and what I’ve learned from you so far.

												                                                                                //QED

//p.s: yeah, this is cute, life is cute, that’s why nature controls population and the stocks and math. 
//That’s your 6th sense right there, I hope you’re feeling this. 
//Please help and learn into ‘live’ for everyone everywhere - run main please.

//Yay! now you can read C! You’re smart.
